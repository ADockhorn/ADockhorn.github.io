                        <h3>Abstract</h3>

                        <p>Simulation-based search algorithms have been widely applied in the context of autonomous game-playing. 
                            Their flexibility allows for the rapid development of agents that are able to achieve satisfying 
                            performance in many problem domains. However, these algorithms share two requirements, namely, 
                            access to a forward model and full knowledge of the environment’s state. In this thesis, simulation-based 
                            search algorithms will be adapted to tasks in which either the forward model or the state of the 
                            environment is unknown.</p>

                        <p>To play a game without a forward model, methods for learning the environment’s model from recent 
                            interactions between the agent and the environment are proposed. These forward model learning 
                            techniques allow the agent to predict the outcome of its actions, and therefore, enable a 
                            prediction-based search process. An analysis of environment models shows how they can be 
                            represented and learned in the form of an end-to-end forward model. Based on this general approach, 
                            three methods are proposed which reduce the number of possible models and, thus, the training time 
                            required. The proposed forward model learning techniques are evaluated according to their applicability 
                            to general game-learning tasks and validated based on a wide variety of games. The results show the applicability 
                            of prediction-based search agents for games where the forward model is not accessible.</p>

                        <p>In case the environment’s state cannot be fully observed by the agent and the number of possible states 
                            is low, state determinisation methods, which uniformly sample possible states have shown to perform well. 
                            However, if the number of states is high, the uniform state sampling approach performs worse than non-determinising 
                            search methods due to the search process spending too much time on unlikely states. In this thesis, two methods 
                            for predictive state determinisation are proposed. These sample probable states based on the agent’s partial 
                            observation of the current state and a database of previously played games, which allows the agent to focus 
                            its search process on likely states. Proposed algorithms are evaluated in terms of their prediction accuracy 
                            and game-playing performance in the context of the collectible card game Hearthstone. Results show that the 
                            implemented agent outperforms other state-of-the-art agents in case the replay database is representative 
                            for the state distribution.</p>
