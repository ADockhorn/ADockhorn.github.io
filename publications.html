                                    Computational intelligence agents can reach expert levels in many known games,
                                    such as Chess, Go, and Morris. Those systems incorporate powerful machine learning
                                    algorithms, which are able to learn from, e.g., observations, play-traces, or by
                                    reinforcement learning. While many black box systems, such as deep neural networks,
                                    are able to achieve high performance in a wide range of applications, they generally
                                    lack interpretability. Additionally, previous systems often focused on a single or a
                                    small set of games, which makes it a cumbersome task to rebuild and retrain the
                                    agent for each possible application. This paper proposes a method, which extracts
                                    an interpretable set of game rules for previously unknown games. Frequent pattern
                                    mining is used to find common observation patterns in the game environment. Finally,
                                    game rules as well as winning-/losing-conditions are extracted via association
                                    rule analysis. Our evaluation shows that a wide range of game rules can be
                                    successfully extracted from previously unknown games. We further highlight how the
                                    application of fuzzy methods can advance our efforts in generating explainable
                                    artifical intelligence (AI) agents.

                                    Strategy games are complex environments often used in AI- research to evaluate
                                    new algorithms. Despite the common- alities of most strategy games, often research
                                    is focused on one game only, which may lead to bias or overfitting to a particular
                                    environment. In this paper, we motivate and present STRATEGA - a general strategy
                                    games framework for playing n-player turn-based and real-time strategy games.
                                    The platform currently implements turn-based games, which can be configured via
                                    YAML-files. It exposes an API with access to a forward model to facilitate research
                                    on statistical forward plan- ning agents. The framework and agents can log
                                    information during games for analysing and debugging algorithms. We also present
                                    some sample rule-based agents, as well as search- based agents like Monte Carlo
                                    Tree Search and Rolling Hori- zon Evolution, and quantitatively analyse their
                                    performance to demonstrate the use of the framework. Results, although purely
                                    illustrative, show the known problems that traditional search-based agents have
                                    when dealing with high branching factors in these games. STRATEGA can be downloaded at:

                                    Stratega, a general strategy games framework, has been designed to foster research
                                    on computational intelligence for strategy games. In contrast to other strategy game
                                    frameworks, Stratega allows to create a wide variety of turn-based and real-time
                                    strategy games using a common API for agent development. While the current version
                                    supports the development of turn-based strategy games and agents, we will add support
                                    for real-time strategy games in future updates. Flexibility is achieved by utilising
                                    YAML-files to configure tiles, units, actions, and levels. Therefore, the user can
                                    design and run a variety of games to test developed agents without specifically
                                    adjusting it to the game being generated. The framework has been built with a focus
                                    of statistical forward planning (SFP) agents. For this purpose, agents can access
                                    and modify game-states and use the forward model to simulate the outcome of their
                                    actions. While SFP agents have shown great flexibility in general game-playing, their
                                    performance is limited in case of complex state and action-spaces. Finally, we hope
                                    that the development of this framework and its respective agents helps to better
                                    understand the complex decision-making process in strategy games. Stratega can be

                                    This document describes the design and implementation of the Tabletop Games framework (TAG),
                                    a Java-based benchmark for developing modern board games for AI research.
                                    TAG provides a common skeleton for implementing tabletop games based on a common
                                    API for AI agents, a set of components and classes to easily add new games and an
                                    import module for defining data in JSON format. At present, this platform includes
                                    the implementation of seven different tabletop games that can also be used as an
                                    example for further developments. Additionally, TAG also incorporates logging
                                    functionality that allows the user to perform a detailed analysis of the game, in
                                    terms of action space, branching factor, hidden information, and other measures of
                                    interest for Game AI research. The objective of this document is to serve as a central
                                    point where the framework can be described at length. TAG can be downloaded at:

                                    Forward model learning algorithms enable the application of simulation-based
                                    search methods in environments for which the forward model is unknown.
                                    Multiple studies have shown great performance in game-related and motion control
                                    applications. In these, forward model learning agents often required less training time
                                    while achieving a similar performance than state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
                                    methods. However, several problems can emerge when replacing the environment’s
                                    true model with a learned approximation. While the true forward model allows the
                                    accurate prediction of future time-steps, a learned forward model may always be
                                    inaccurate in its prediction. These inaccuracies become problematic when planning
                                    long action sequences since the confidence in predicted time-steps reduces with
                                    increasing depth of the simulation. In this work, we explore methods for balancing
                                    risk and reward in decision-making using inaccurate forward models. Therefore, we
                                    propose methods for measuring the variance of a forward model and the confidence
                                    in the predicted outcome of planned action sequences. Based on these metrics, we
                                    define methods for learning and using forward models under consideration of their
                                    current prediction accuracy. Proposed methods have been tested in various motion
                                    control tasks of the Open AI Gym framework. Results show that the information on
                                    the model’s accuracy can be used to increase the efficiency of the agent’s training
                                    and the agent’s performance during evaluation.

                                        In the context of partially-observable scenarios agent’s require the state to be
                                        fully determinized. Especially in case of collectible cards games, the sheer
                                        number of decks constructed by players hinder an agent to reliably estimate the
                                        game’s current state, and therefore, renders the search ineffective. In this
                                        paper, we propose the use of a (fuzzy) multiset representation to describe
                                        frequently played decks. Extracted deck prototypes have shown to match human
                                        expert labels well and seem to serve as an efficient abstraction of the deck
                                        space. We further show that such deck prototypes allow the agent to predict
                                        upcoming cards with high accuracy, therefore, allowing more accurate sampling
                                        procedures for search-based agents.

                                        This paper provides an overview of the recently proposed forward model approximation framework for learning games of the general video game artificial intelligence (GVGAI) framework. In contrast to other general game-playing algorithms, the proposed agent model does not need a full description of the game but can learn the game’s rules by observing game state transitions. Based on hierarchical knowledge bases, the forward model can be learned and revised during game-play, improving the accuracy of the agent’s state predictions over time. This allows the application of simulation-based search algorithms and belief revision techniques to previously unknown settings. We show that the proposed framework is able to quickly learn a model for dynamic environments in the context of the GVGAI framework.                                    </div>

                                    <div><b>Abstract</b>:
                                        <p>Simulation-based search algorithms have been widely applied in the context of autonomous game-playing.
                                            Their flexibility allows for the rapid development of agents that are able to achieve satisfying
                                            performance in many problem domains. However, these algorithms share two requirements, namely,
                                            access to a forward model and full knowledge of the environment’s state. In this thesis, simulation-based
                                            search algorithms will be adapted to tasks in which either the forward model or the state of the
                                            environment is unknown.</p>

                                        <p>To play a game without a forward model, methods for learning the environment’s model from recent
                                            interactions between the agent and the environment are proposed. These forward model learning
                                            techniques allow the agent to predict the outcome of its actions, and therefore, enable a
                                            prediction-based search process. An analysis of environment models shows how they can be
                                            represented and learned in the form of an end-to-end forward model. Based on this general approach,
                                            three methods are proposed which reduce the number of possible models and, thus, the training time
                                            required. The proposed forward model learning techniques are evaluated according to their applicability
                                            to general game-learning tasks and validated based on a wide variety of games. The results show the applicability
                                            of prediction-based search agents for games where the forward model is not accessible.</p>

                                        <p>In case the environment’s state cannot be fully observed by the agent and the number of possible states
                                            is low, state determinisation methods, which uniformly sample possible states have shown to perform well.
                                            However, if the number of states is high, the uniform state sampling approach performs worse than non-determinising
                                            search methods due to the search process spending too much time on unlikely states. In this thesis, two methods
                                            for predictive state determinisation are proposed. These sample probable states based on the agent’s partial
                                            observation of the current state and a database of previously played games, which allows the agent to focus
                                            its search process on likely states. Proposed algorithms are evaluated in terms of their prediction accuracy
                                            and game-playing performance in the context of the collectible card game Hearthstone. Results show that the
                                            implemented agent outperforms other state-of-the-art agents in case the replay database is representative
                                            for the state distribution.</p>

                                        This paper investigates the effect of learning a forward model on the performance
                                        of a statistical forward planning agent. We transform Conway’s Game of Life simulation
                                        into a single-player game where the objective can be either to preserve as much life
                                        as possible or to extinguish all life as quickly as possible. In order to learn the
                                        forward model of the game, we formulate the problem in a novel way that learns the
                                        local cell transition function by creating a set of supervised training data and
                                        predicting the next state of each cell in the grid based on its current state and
                                        immediate neighbours. Using this method we are able to harvest sufficient data to
                                        learn perfect forward models by observing only a few complete state transitions,
                                        using either a look-up table, a decision tree, or a neural network. In contrast,
                                        learning the complete state transition function is a much harder task and our initial
                                        efforts to do this using deep convolutional auto-encoders were less successful. We also
                                        investigate the effects of imperfect learned models on prediction errors and game-playing
                                        performance, and show that even models with significant errors can provide good performance.

                                        This paper examines learning approaches for forward models based on local cell transition functions.
                                        We provide a formal definition of local forward models for which we propose two basic learning approaches.
                                        Our analysis is based on the game Sokoban, where a wrong action can lead to an unsolvable game state.
                                        Therefore, an accurate prediction of an action’s resulting state is necessary to avoid this scenario.
                                        In contrast to learning the complete state transition function, local forward models allow extracting
                                        multiple training examples from a single state transition. In this way, the Hash Set model, as well
                                        as the Decision Tree model, quickly learn to predict upcoming state transitions of both the training
                                        and the test set. Applying the model using a statistical forward planner showed that the best models
                                        can be used to satisfying degree even in cases in which the test levels have not yet been seen.
                                        Our evaluation includes an analysis of various local neighbourhood patterns and sizes to test the
                                        learners’ capabilities in case too few or too many attributes are extracted, of which the latter has
                                        shown do degrade the performance of the model learner.

                                        The Hearthstone AI framework and competition motivates the development of artificial intelligence agents that can play collectible card games. A special feature of those games is the high variety of cards, which can be chosen by the players to create their own decks. In contrast to simpler card games, the value of many cards is determined by their possible synergies. The vast amount of possible decks, the randomness of the game, as well as the restricted information during the player's turn offer quite a hard challenge for the development of game-playing agents. This short paper introduces the competition framework and goes into more detail on the problems and challenges that need to be faced during the development process.

                                        Developing agents for automated game playing is a demanding task in the general
                                        game production cycle. Especially the involvement of frequent balance changes after
                                        the release, e.g. as they often occur in collectible card games, require constant
                                        updates of the developed agent. The game’s developers need to constantly analyze
                                        and understand the current meta-game for adjusting the agent’s parameters,
                                        making balance changes to the game and ultimately sustaining the satisfaction
                                        of its player base. The underlying analysis largely depends on evaluating players’
                                        playtraces. Necessary adjustments to the agent’s and the game’s parameters are taken
                                        care of by the game’s developers. This paper proposes a first step in automatically
                                        observing the current state of a collectible card game, which will assist the developers
                                        in their understanding of established deck archetypes and, therefore, speed up the
                                        update cycle. Fuzzy multisets are used for modeling decks and frequently occurring
                                        subsets of cards. We propose the definition of a (fuzzy) multiset centroid to uniquely
                                        represent the cluster and its contained decks and show that it better matches the deck
                                        archetype than the often reported deck core. The proposed clustering procedure identifies
                                        deck archetypes and takes track of its common variants in the current meta-game.
                                        We evaluate the approach by comparing the result of our clustering procedure with a
                                        hand-labeled data set and show that it is able to reproduce clusters of similar
                                        quality to a labeling provided by experts.

                                        In this paper we propose a model decomposition architecture, which advances on
                                        our previous attempts of learning an approximated forward model for unknown games.
                                        The developed model architecture is based on design constraints of the General Video Game
                                        Artificial Intelligence Competition and the Video Game Definition Language.
                                        Our agent first builds up a database of interactions with the game environment for
                                        each distinct component of a game. We further train a decision tree model for each
                                        of those independent components. For predicting a future state we query each model
                                        individually and aggregate the result. The developed model ensemble does not just
                                        predict known states with a high accuracy, but also adapts very well to previously
                                        unseen levels or situations. Future work will show how well the increased accuracy
                                        helps in playing an unknown game using simulation-based search algorithms such as
                                        Monte Carlo Tree Search.

                                        In this paper we propose a model decomposition architecture, which advances on
                                        our previous attempts of learning an approximated forward model for unknown games.
                                        The developed model architecture is based on design constraints of the General Video Game
                                        Artificial Intelligence Competition and the Video Game Definition Language.
                                        Our agent first builds up a database of interactions with the game environment for
                                        each distinct component of a game. We further train a decision tree model for each
                                        of those independent components. For predicting a future state we query each model
                                        individually and aggregate the result. The developed model ensemble does not just
                                        predict known states with a high accuracy, but also adapts very well to previously
                                        unseen levels or situations. Future work will show how well the increased accuracy
                                        helps in playing an unknown game using simulation-based search algorithms such as
                                        Monte Carlo Tree Search.

                                        This paper proposes a novel learning agent model for a General Video Game Playing agent.
                                        Our agent learns an approximation of the forward model from repeatedly playing a game
                                        and subsequently adapting its behavior to previously unseen levels. To achieve this,
                                        it first learns the game mechanics through machine learning techniques and then extracts
                                        rulebased symbolic knowledge on different levels of abstraction. When being confronted
                                        with new levels of a game, the agent is able to revise its knowledge by a novel belief
                                        revision approach. Using methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Breadth First Search,
                                        it searches for the best possible action using simulated game episodes. Those simulations
                                        are only possible due to reasoning about future states using the extracted rulebased knowledge
                                        from random episodes during the learning phase. The developed agent outperforms previous
                                        agents by a large margin, while still being limited in its prediction capabilities.
                                        The proposed forward model approximation opens a new class of solutions in the context
                                        of General Video Game Playing, which do not try to learn a value function, but try to
                                        increase their accuracy in modelling the game.

                                        Games pose many interesting questions for the development of artificial intelligence agents.
                                        Especially popular are methods that guide the decision-making process of an autonomous agent,
                                        which is tasked to play a certain game. In previous studies, the heuristic search method Monte
                                        Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) was successfully applied to a wide range of games. Results showed that
                                        this method can often reach playing capabilities on par with humans or even better. However,
                                        the characteristics of collectible card games such as the online game Hearthstone make it
                                        infeasible to apply MCTS directly. Uncertainty in the opponent’s hand cards, the card draw,
                                        and random card effects considerably restrict the simulation depth of MCTS. We show that
                                        knowledge gathered from a database of human replays help to overcome this problem by predicting
                                        multiple card distributions. Those predictions can be used to increase the simulation depth of
                                        MCTS. For this purpose, we calculate bigram-rates of frequently co-occurring cards to predict
                                        multiple sets of hand cards for our opponent. Those predictions can be used to create an ensemble
                                        of MCTS agents, which work under the assumption of differing card distributions and perform
                                        simulations according to their assigned distribution. The proposed ensemble approach outperforms
                                        other agents on the game Hearthstone, including various types of MCTS. Our case study shows that
                                        uncertainty can be handled effectively using predictions of sufficient accuracy, ultimately,
                                        improving the MCTS guided decision-making process. The resulting decision-making based on such
                                        an MCTS ensemble proved to be less prone to errors by uncertainty and opens up a new class of MCTS algorithms.

                                        This work builds up on previous research by Sievers and Helmert, who developed an Monte Carlo
                                        Tree Search based doppelkopf agent. This four player card game features a larger state
                                        space than skat due to the unknown cards of the contestants. Additionally, players face
                                        the unique problem of not knowing their teammates at the start of the game. Figuring out
                                        the player parties is a key feature of this card game and demands differing play styles
                                        depending on the current knowledge of the game state. In this work we enhance the Monte
                                        Carlo Tree Search agent created by Sievers and Helmert with a decision heuristic.
                                        Our goal is to improve the quality of playouts, by suggesting high quality moves
                                        and predicting enemy moves based on a neural network classifier. This classifier is
                                        trained on an extensive history of expert player moves recorded during official doppelkopf
                                        tournaments. Different network architectures are discussed and evaluated based on their
                                        prediction accuracy. The best perform- ing network was tested in a direct comparison with
                                        the previous Monte Carlo Tree Search agent by Sievers and Helmert. We show that high quality
                                        predictions increase the quality of playouts. Overall, our simulations show that adding the
                                        decision heuristic increased the strength of play under comparable computational effort.

                                        Fitting a parametric curve to unordered point cloud data is a frequently
                                        encountered problem in areas, where raster data has to be vectorized,
                                        or advanced geometric descriptors of point clouds are to be found. Existing
                                        approaches often struggle with certain geometric properties, such as varying
                                        density, self-intersections, sharp corners, or are only designed to handle
                                        low-dimensional and discrete data. With the purpose to overcome these difficulties,
                                        the applicability of evolutionary algorithms to the topic of curve approximation is
                                        studied in this work. Based on the popular algorithm NSGA-II, an implementation has
                                        been developed that uses the distance to the point cloud and the number of control
                                        points of a curve as objective functions. The evaluation reveals that the proposed
                                        objective functions control the evolutionary process well, and the final curves fit
                                        most of the evaluated data sets correctly. The results of the study indicate the
                                        usefulness of genetic algorithms for the topic of curve fitting and form a basis
                                        for future research in this area.

                                        In this paper we discuss our recent approach for evolving a diverse set of agents
                                        for both the Pac-Man and the Ghost Team track of the current Ms. Pac-Man vs. Ghost Team
                                        competition. We used genetic programming for generating various agents, which were
                                        distributed in multiple populations. The optimization includes cooperative and adversarial
                                        subtasks, such that Pac-Man is constantly competing against the Ghost Team, whereas the
                                        Ghost Team is formed of four cooperatively evolving populations. For the generation of a
                                        Ghost Team and calculation of the associated fitness we took one individual from each population.
                                        This strict separation preserves the evolution pressure for each population such that respective
                                        Ghost Teams compete against each other in developing an efficient cooperation in catching
                                        Pac-Man. This approach not only is useful for developing a versatile set of playing agents,
                                        but also for adapting the team to the current behavior of the competing populations.
                                        Ultimately, we aim for optimizing both tasks in parallel.

                                        The class of density-based clustering algorithms excels in detecting clusters of arbitrary
                                        shape. DBSCAN, the most common representative, has been demonstrated to be useful in a lot
                                        of applications. Still the algorithm suffers from two drawbacks, namely a non-trivial
                                        parameter estimation for a given dataset and the limitation to data sets with constant
                                        cluster density. The first was already addressed in our previous work, where we presented
                                        two hierarchical implementations of DBSCAN. In combination with a simple optimization procedure,
                                        those proofed to be useful in detecting appropriate parameter estimates based on an objective
                                        function. However, our algorithm was not capable of producing clusters of differing density.
                                        In this work we will use the hierarchical information to extract variable density clusters and
                                        nested cluster structures. Our evaluation shows that the clustering approach based on
                                        edge-lengths of the dendrogram or based on area estimates successfully detects clusters
                                        of arbitrary shape and density.

                                    DBSCAN is one of the most commonly used density-based clustering algorithms.
                                    While it performs good in various clustering scenarios, finding appropriate parameters
                                    for the algorithm is a non-trivial task. Multiple works proposed parameter estimation

                                    issues and the incapability of finding clusters of different densities. In this work
                                    we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to find locally optimal parameter
                                    combinations for DBSCAN. It combines two hierarchical versions of DBSCAN, which are
                                    generated by fixing one parameter and iterating through the parameter space of the
                                    other. Due to the monotonicity of the parameter space, successive hierarchy levels
                                    can efficiently be computed. Hierarchies generated this way can be analyzed to find
                                    an appropriate estimate for the free parameter or finding clusters with different
                                    densities by the use of non-horizontal cuts. An internal validation criterion is
                                    used to find an appropriate horizontal cut. Throughout this work we compare multiple
                                    internal validation measures and propose a density-based interpretation of the
                                    silhouette coefficient. Our results show that the proposed density-based silhouette
                                    coefficient adapts well to non-convex clusters produced by DBSCAN.
                                    Also, the alternating optimization approach automatically detects a good parameter
                                    combination in a variety of clustering scenarios. Additionally, non-hierarchical cuts
                                    performed especially well in the detection of clusters with different densities.

                                        DBSCAN is one of the most common density-based clustering algorithms. While
                                        multiple works tried to present an appropriate estimate for needed parameters
                                        we propose an alternating optimization algorithm, which finds a locally optimal
                                        parameter combination. The algorithm is based on the combination of two
                                        hierarchical versions of DBSCAN, which can be generated by fixing one parameter
                                        and iterating through possible values of the second parameter. Due to monotonicity
                                        of the neighborhood sets and the core-condition, successive levels of the hierarchy
                                        can efficiently be computed. An local optimal parameter combination can be
                                        determined using internal cluster validation measures. In this work we are comparing
                                        the measures edge-correlation and silhouette coefficient. For the latter we propose
                                        a density-based interpretation and show a respective computational efficient estimate
                                        to detect non-convex clusters produced by DBSCAN. Our results show, that the
                                        algorithm can automatically detect a good DBSCAN clustering on a variety of cluster
                                        scenarios.

                                        Modeling social interaction can be based on graphs. However most models lack
                                        the flexibility of including larger changes over time. The Barabási-Albert-model
                                        is a generative model which already offers mechanisms for adding nodes. We will
                                        extent this by presenting four methods for merging and five for dividing graphs
                                        based on the Barabási-Albert-model. Our algorithms were motivated by different
                                        real world scenarios and focus on preserving graph properties derived from these
                                        scenarios. With little alterations in the parameter estimation those algorithms
                                        can be used for other graph models as well. All algorithms were tested in multiple
                                        experiments using graphs based on the Barabási-Albert-model, an extended
                                        version of the Barabási-Albert-model by Holme and Kim, the Watts-Strogatz-model
                                        and the Erdős-Rényi-model. Furthermore we concluded that our algorithms are able
                                        to preserve different properties of graphs independently from the used model. To support
                                        the choice of algorithm, we created a guideline which highlights advantages and
                                        disadvantages of discussed methods and their possible use-cases.

                                        Methods for clustering static graphs
                                        cannot always be transfered straight forward to dynamic
                                        scenarios. A typical approach is to reduce the
                                        number of updates by reusing results of previous iterations.
                                        But are there natural ways to implement
                                        dynamic graph clustering? This paper proposes a
                                        method which was derived by graph based ant colony
                                        algorithms. Similar to other clustering algorithms,
                                        multiple ant colonies are competing for the available nodes.
                                        Each hive creates ants, which will explore nearby graph structures
                                        and drop hive-specific pheromones on visited nodes. Over time, hives will
                                        collect nodes and will be relocated to the center of
                                        all collected nodes. In case of dynamic graph clustering, pheromone
                                        values can be reused in consecutive
                                        iterations. Our evaluation revealed that the proposed
                                        algorithm can lead to results on a par with the k-median algorithm and performs worse than Louvain
                                        clustering. However competing ant hives have the
                                        advantage of implicit noise detection, which comes at
                                        the cost of longer computation times. This can make
                                        it a suitable choice for certain clustering tasks.

                                    The presented thesis addresses the generation of hypotheses in the area of oncology,
                                    which can be used as foundation for future clinical studies. Therefor an interactive
                                    procedure is presented, which divides the set of patients into subsets to reduce the
                                    number of attribute combinations in each subset. This should restrict the number of
                                    generated hypotheses to those relevant for the current object of investigation.
                                    Markov networks of diverse subsets are computed to get an overview of available patient
                                    data. Differences and commonalities of calculated models can be highlighted in a
                                    comparison view. This can provide suggestions for further investigations of certain
                                    dependencies. A subsequent association analysis will be limited to dependent attributes.
                                    The capabilities of the proposed procedure will be illustrated on the basis of a test data set,
                                    where known underlying association rules could be extracted, while the search efforts could be
                                    significantly reduced in comparison to a standard association analysis.

                                        Social Network Analysis in the last decade has gained remarkable attention.
                                         The current analysis focuses more and more on the dynamic behavior of them.
                                         The underlying structure from Social Networks, like facebook, or twitter,
                                         can change over time. Groups can be merged or single nodes can move from one
                                         group to another. But these phenomenas do not only occur in social networks
                                         but also in human brains. The research in neural spike trains also focuses on
                                         finding functional communities. These communities can change over time by
                                         switching the stimuli presented to the subject. In this paper we introduce
                                         a data generator to create such dynamic behavior, with effects in the interactions
                                         between nodes. We generate time stamps for events for one-to-one, one-to-many,
                                         and many-to-all relations. This data could be used to demonstrate the functionality
                                         of algorithms on such data, e.g. clustering or visualization algorithms. We
                                         demonstrated that the generated data fulfills common properties of social networks.

                                    The Barabási-Albert-model is commonly used to
                                    generate scale-free graphs, like social networks. To generate dynamics
                                    in these networks, methods for altering such graphs are needed.
                                    Growing and shrinking is done simply by doing further generation
                                    iterations or undo them. In our paper we present four methods to merge
                                    two graphs based on the Barabási-Albert- model, and five strategies to
                                    reverse them. First we compared these algorithms by edge preservation,
                                    which describes the ratio of the inner structure kept after altering.
                                    To check if hubs in the initial graphs are hubs in the resulting graphs
                                    as well, we used the node-degree rank correlation. Finally we tested how
                                    well the node-degree distribution follows the power-law function from the
                                    Barabási-Albert-model.
